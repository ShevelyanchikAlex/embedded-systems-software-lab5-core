## Embedded Systems Software (lab-5)

### A protocol for two-way communication with a PC via a COM port (Core).

### Implemented functionality

* Sending values from the light sensor, potentiometer and temperature sensor to PC via COM-port.
* Receiving messages from the PC via COM-port and depending on this processing the outgoing message.
* Ability to change delay time (1000/3000).
* Depending on values from the light sensor change color on RGB-Led.
* Depending on values from the temperature sensor change RED/BLUE-Leds (transition temperature +15Â°C).
